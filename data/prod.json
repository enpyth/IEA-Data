        "brief_introduction": "Biography\nI am an implementation scientist and early career health services researcher at the Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation, Queensland University of Technology (QUT). My current research uses implementation science methodologies to increase the adoption and use of evidence-based practices to improve the quality, effectiveness, and equity of health services. In this role I use mixed-method approaches to work collaboratively with multi-disciplinary stakeholders to design, plan, implement and evaluate health service change. Taking time to ensure meaningful engagement with consumers, service providers and communities is at the core of this work. I am also a qualified Cardiac Physiologist and previous clinical work in national and international healthcare systems provides a wealth of experience to draw on when engaging with stakeholders at all levels.\n\nI have successfully collaborated on research projects with government health departments at local, state, and federal levels, as well as with non-government organisations, community groups and clinicians across numerous hospitals and health services. By drawing on implementation science methodologies throughout my work, I have been able to generate meaningful knowledge about project implementation that has been used in future decision-making and project planning. A hallmark of my work is also taking a pragmatic, collaborative, co-design approach which leads to increased stakeholder buy-in, ownership, and capacity building among partners.\n\nI  also have experience in teaching, mentoring and leadership. I successfully led a post-graduate unit at QUT, teaching and mentoring health service staff in the pragmatic application of implementation science methodology. Additionally, I am a long-serving member of the leading professional association for cardiac rehabilitation (Australian Cardiovascular Health and Rehabilitation Association), acting as Queensland state president, state representative and national research subcommittee co-chair.\n\n\nMy research interests fall into three broad categories:\n\nWhile I have the greatest skills, knowledge and interest in these three areas, I am more than happy to supervise HDR research projects that relate to any of these areas of research practice e.g exercise training for other chronic diseases",

        "brief_introduction": "Dr Alexandra Adams is a Lecturer and early career researcher in the School of Psychological Sciences at the University of Newcastle. Her research investigates how cognitive functioning and social behaviour are influenced by various changes across both the central and enteric nervous systems. Indeed, while Dr Adams' early work focused primarily on enhancing understanding of social cognitive function in stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and healthy aging, her current program of research heavily centres around the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In particular, Dr Adams seeks to increase understanding of the role the gut may play in cognitive functioning, social behaviour, and emotional wellbeing. In service of these goals, Dr Adams applies a wide range of sophisticated scientific approaches including cross-sectional research, longitudinal designs, and meta-analytic methods.",

I attained my PhD from Monash University in the field of clinical neuroscience in 2011. I also obtained accredited training in psychology from Monash University and at the Swinburne University of Technology.\nMy research interests are in understanding social cognitive and emotional processes in humans, and in particular, how mental health conditions and ageing affect these processes. My research incorporates a variety of neuroscience equipment (such as MRI, EEG, DTI, EMG, tDCS and fNIRS), statistical software, computer interfaces, cognitive assessments, and neuropsychopharmacological manipulations. I have extensive experience working in drug administration research studies involving randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials in humans - this has involved agents such as antidepressants (SSRIs), serotonergic precursors (tryptophan), and more recently neuropeptides (oxytocin) in healthy young and older cohorts as well as clinical cohorts such as Social Anxiety Disorder, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, and Huntington's disease. I have also worked in industry (sponsored) clinical trials in Huntington's disease cohorts. I am therefore experienced in various operating procedures for clinical trials including drug blinding and randomisation procedures, monitoring, Human Research Ethics Committee applications, clinical trials registries (e.g., ANZCTR), Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) applications, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as well as dealing with stakeholders.\nOverall, with my research I strive to understand the neurobiological and neuropharmacological mechanisms implicated in dysfunctional social cognitive and emotional processes in humans, with an aim to improve quality of life and develop more refined treatment options for mental health conditions.\nVISIT: Google Scholar | Researchgate | Twitter",

His research centred on the role that autistic-like traits play in the allocation of attention, with specific interests in attentional lateralization, global/local processing, and emotion processing. This work culminated in developing a new measure of autistic traits, the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI), which has been embraced by both the autism research and clinical community for the inclusiveness of autistic characteristics assessed.\nMichael is a currently a Senior Project Officer with the Healing Kids, Healing Families team at The Kids Research Institute Australia led by Prof Jeneva Ohan (UWA profile / The Kids profile), and supports the team across a number of research projects aiming to better understand and overcome trauma and adversity that negatively impact children.\nCurrent (recent) research projects involve developing a novel assessment dissociation in childhood and adolescents, and improving parent interactions with the WA Newborn Emergency Transport Service.",

        "brief_introduction": "I am a Research Associate in Data Analytics within the STEM unit at the University of South Australia (UniSA). I received my PhD in Data Science from UniSA in 2021. My research interests span methodological advances in machine learning as well as applied AI in high-impact domains.\n\nMy recent research focuses on three main areas:\n- Remote Sensing and Earth Observation: Development of onboard AI for early fire-smoke detection using hyperspectral satellite imagery. My work addresses the challenges of lightweight, energy-efficient model deployment on constrained satellite platforms, with applications to upcoming missions. More broadly, my research contributes to advancing AI for Earth observation tasks, including emulation studies, efficient onboard processing, and robust smoke localization.\n- Biomedical Applications: Predictive modeling of epileptic seizures using intracranial EEG and scalp EEG data. My work explores both deep learning and signal-processing-based approaches, including channel coherence analysis and time-series modeling, to improve accuracy, robustness, and clinical interpretability. This research contributes to the broader field of AI for healthcare, with implications for personalized medicine and neurological disorder management.\n- Anomaly Detection: Development of novel frameworks that integrate dependency, proximity, and probabilistic modeling for effective detection of rare and abnormal events. My contributions include general frameworks, benchmarking methodologies, and algorithms such as LogDP and LoPAD, which advance both the theoretical foundation and practical applications of anomaly detection across domains.\nAlongside my academic research, I bring more than 20 years of experience across academia and industry. Before joining UniSA, I spent over a decade as a software engineer and project manager at Huawei Technologies, contributing to more than 26 international patents in wireless communication. I also have extensive expertise in large-scale software development (Python, R, C, and C++) and project management, leading teams ranging from small groups to projects with over a thousand members.",

After completing his PhD, Regan received a two year Early Career Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Tuebingen, Germany, as part of the European Union, Marie-Curie European Training Program, with Dr Marita Feldkaemper and Professor Frank Schaeffel. On returning to Australia, Regan took up a lecturing position at the University of Canberra in 2011 before accepting the position of Assistant Professor within the Faculty in 2012. He now heads the Visual Neuroscience Group within the Centre for Research into Therapeutic Solutions (Health Research Institute). \nRegan's research focuses on the molecular pathways underlying the regulation of normal ocular growth, and how such neural pathways are affected during the development of the visual disorder myopia (short-sightedness). Myopia is now at epidemic proportion in many parts of the world, most notably in urban East Asia, where 80-90% of school-leavers are myopic. Recently, Regan's research has shown that exposure to bright light levels; similar to that experienced by being outdoors, can prevent the development of experimental myopia in animal models. This protection appears to be driven by light-induced increases in the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the eye. This work has culminated in Regan being awarded the prestigious Attempto Prize for Neuroscience, from the University of Tuebingen, Germany (2010), and the Carl Zeiss Young Investigators Award in Vision Science (2013).  \nRegan's current research looks at better understanding the genomic and epigenomic regulatory mechanisms by which exposure to high light levels can retard the development of myopia. \nResearch interests\nInvestigating the underlying causes of the visual disorder myopia (short-sightedness)\nGenomic/epigenomic regulation of ocular growth\nRetinal neural development",
